Based on the finding we can say that the above factors (physiological and anthropometrical) contribute to the powerlifter's heavy weightlifting capabilities, when compared to light and middleweight categories powerlifters (Brechue & Abe, 2002).",

All the selected powerlifters were measured on physiological and anthropometric parameters (Chiari, et al., 2002).",
